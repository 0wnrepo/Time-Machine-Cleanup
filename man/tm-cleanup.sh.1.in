.Sh NAME
.Nm tm-cleanup.sh
.Nd Zsh script to clean up Time Machine backups and reduce their size.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tm-cleanup.sh [-d days] [-n number] [-f] [-x]
.Nm tm-cleanup.sh -h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script is a Zsh script that lists the completed Time Machine snapshots and
deletes those that satisfy the specified criteria.  Two types of deletion
criteria exist:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It -
By date: snapshots that are older than a specified number of days are
deleted.  The default threshold is 30 days.
.It -
By number: a maximum number of snapshots is retained and oldest snapshots are
deleted.
.El
.Pp
Only one deletion criteria can be specified.
.Pp
The following options are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar days
Backups older than
.Ar days
will be deleted.
.It Fl n Ar number
Retain a maximum
.Ar number
of backups.
.It Fl f
By default
.Nm
exits and prints an error message if a Time Machine backup is currently in
progress. This option forces the backup deletion concurrently.
.It Fl h
Print the help message and exit.
.It Fl x
Perform a
.Em dry
clean: print the list of operations that will be performed and exit..
.El
.Sh INTERACTIVE INTERFACE
.Nm
also provides an interactive interface which is useful if the user wishes to
pick which backups to delete using a dialog-based interface.  The interactive
interface can be launched by passing no arguments to the script:
.Pp
.Dl $ tm-cleanup.sh
.Pp
The interactive interface guides the user through the backup deletion process:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It -
The interactive interface starts with a menu showing the available operations a
user can perform.
.It -
The
.Em Delete backups
operation brings the user to a dialog where the backups to delete can be
selected.  By default, backups are shown in reverse chronological order (i.e.:
latest first) and all except the first are selected.
.It -
The backups deletion may take a long time to complete, during which a progress
dialog is shown.
.It -
At the end of the deletion, a confirmation is shown to the user.
.It -
The script prevents users to delete all the backups.  If all the backups are
selected, an error message is shown.
.El
.Sh REQUIREMENTS
The command-line interface of this script requires Zsh.  To use the dialog-based
interface,
.Em dialog
is required.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Nm
can be used on any system supporting Time Machine and the
.Em tmutil(8)
interface.
